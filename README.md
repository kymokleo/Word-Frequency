# Word Frequency Counter

The Word Frequency Counter is a command-line tool that compute word frequencies of a given text file and output the results in JSON.

Run the script with:

```
python main.py input_file.txt -o output.json
```

`input_file.txt` is the input file path, and `output.json` is the optional output file path. Results are printed to the console if not specified.
